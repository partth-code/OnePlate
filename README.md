🌍 Project Info – OnePlate: Bridging Surplus to Hunger
In cities like Mumbai and Delhi, thousands of weddings and large-scale events take place every single day. While these celebrations bring joy to many, they also generate tons of surplus food — enough to feed over 100,000 people daily. At the same time, more than 50,000 individuals in these very cities go to sleep hungry and undernourished.

The issue is not the availability of food — it's the lack of a real-time, accessible, and reliable system to connect the dots between excess and need.

That’s where OnePlate comes in.

🍽️ OnePlate – One Plate Can Make a Difference
OnePlate is a tech-driven platform designed to rescue surplus food from events, restaurants, and households, and redistribute it to shelters, orphanages, and individuals who need it the most.

Using a combination of smart logistics, community engagement, and real-time tracking, OnePlate ensures:

💡 Instant alerts from donors (event organizers, caterers, etc.)

🛵 Rapid pickups and safe delivery through partnered NGOs or our own volunteers

📍 Location-based matching of food donors and nearby recipients

🧾 Transparency through donor dashboards and contribution logs

💚 Our Vision
To create a future where no plate goes wasted, and no person goes hungry.
With OnePlate, every extra dish becomes a lifeline, every meal shared becomes a story of hope.
